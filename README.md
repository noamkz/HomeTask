## Overview

=========

Hi, This is my answer to three questions. I chose these questions because they seemed to be the most interesting even though the other questions look like that too; when I have time, I will solve them as well.
I gave a lot of thought to each question, and I was happy that if something is not understood or seems not optimal, you will contact me so that I can explain and learn from the conclusions.

On the questions:
-In the Morse code's first question, there is a brief explanation on the home page of the "site" and a UML chart (class diagram).

-In the Phone Book question, I'm not sure if that was the intention to write to the disc as I did. I did not find a better way than to write a special serialization and deserialization.

-In the Search in log question
There were several ways to do this search, like line-by-line reading, multi-thread whit thread-pool management, and my solution is Memory Mapped File. I tried them all, and from the tests I found that the latter is most effective.

**I hope all got along, and we can work together. The company seems to me like the perfect place to work.**
